## Meta tags used inside head

- <meta name="keywords" content="Learning, HTML" />, here we can put keywords inside here for SEO optimization, but we don't use it for that purpose these days.

## General tags used inside body tag

- We generally don't use the below tags now as they're deprecated because we should not html for styling and use css only for styling
  - <b></b> tag is used for writing something in bold
  - <i></i> tag is used for writing something in italic
- <em></em> tag is used for emphasizing certain content, it's italic by default. It's majorly used for SEO optimization where we want to put emphasis on certain keywords
- <strong></strong> tag is used for same like <em></em> but its bold by default but we can change its styling using css

### All about texts

- Heading tags should only be used for setting a hierarchy among them. Common mistake that people do is that they use it for styling purposes but we can always change the styling of some tag. We should only use <h1></h1> tag once in our web page for setting a hierarchy. If we use multiple h1 tags it'd confuse SEO engines. Therefore, using multiple h1 tags for styling reasons only is not a good SEO practice.
